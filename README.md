# Fuzzy Logic Framework for Evaluating LLM-Generated Texts  
*A Master Thesis Project — Ghamaathige Sachindu Himash Peiris*

This repository contains the full implementation of my master's thesis project titled **"Fuzzy Logic for Evaluating LLM-Generated Texts: A Framework for Humanitarian Alignment and Ethical Assessment"**, completed at the University of Fribourg in May 2025.

## 🧠 Project Overview

This project presents a novel **fuzzy logic-based framework** to evaluate and iteratively refine outputs generated by **Large Language Models (LLMs)** in relation to the **humanitarian principle of Humanity**. The system measures alignment across four ethical dimensions:

- Focus on Life and Well-being  
- Targeting Vulnerable Populations  
- Providing Comprehensive Care  
- Preserving Dignity  

Each dimension is evaluated using its own fuzzy sub-system built on linguistic and contextual NLP variables such as sentiment alignment, semantic similarity, pragmatic structure, and named entity distribution. A refinement loop powered by an **LLM-as-a-Judge** mechanism automatically identifies misaligned responses, re-prompts the model, and re-evaluates the outcome for improved alignment.

The project aims to contribute to responsible and ethical AI design by offering a scalable, interpretable, and human-centered evaluation tool.

## 🔧 Back-End Setup (Django)

The back end hosts the fuzzy evaluation logic and provides RESTful endpoints to evaluate and refine text.

### Installation

```bash
cd back_end/
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver
```

### API Endpoints

- `POST /evaluate/` — Submit LLM-generated text to receive fuzzy alignment scores  
- `POST /refine/` — Re-prompt and re-evaluate misaligned outputs automatically

Make sure the backend is running on `http://localhost:8000`.

---

## 💻 Front-End Setup (React)

The front end provides a user-friendly interface to input AI-generated text, view evaluation scores, and trigger refinements.

### Installation

```bash
cd front_end/
npm install
npm start
```

This will launch the interface at `http://localhost:3000`. Make sure the backend is running for full functionality.

## 📊 Evaluation Methods

The `evaluation_methods/` folder contains standalone Python scripts used for:

- **Semantic Similarity Scoring**  
- **Sentiment Analysis (using VADER or transformers)**  
- **LLM-as-a-Judge Scoring**  
- **Entropy Preservation Analysis**

These scripts were used for offline experiments and validation of the fuzzy system.

### Run an Example

```bash
cd evaluation_methods/
python evaluate.py
```

Modify the scripts as needed for your input data and models.
